Add a --edit feature to edit an existing entry
(change stuff)

--add from --input file for bulk import

Some way of entering multiline nodes. Perhaps
the ole 'single . on a line' termination that
mail & smtp use?

Add automatic random username and password generation

Add menu based interaction (--add already does it)

curses based interface?

make secstring use secure storage either with a special allocator class or by rewriting it from scratch

don't read entire db into RAM---just decrypt the name and the string lengths.
--add can be done w/o decrypting anything!

pwsafe-agent mode? (ala ssh-agent)

avoid passing data to klipper & friends by doing a test X selection first and
seeing who grabs it.
