--add from --input file for bulk import

Some way of entering multiline nodes. Perhaps
the ole 'single . on a line' termination that
mail & smtp use?

curses based interface?

make secstring use secure storage either with a special allocator class or by rewriting it from scratch
and/or make it use ram locked in with mlock, and/or the encrypted strings that passwordsafe uses.

don't read entire db into RAM---just decrypt the name and the string lengths.
--add can be done w/o decrypting anything!

pwsafe-agent mode? (ala ssh-agent)

avoid passing data to klipper & friends by doing a test X selection first and
seeing who grabs it. trick seems that klipper changed behavior. in kde 3.0
(redhat 8.0) it polls the primary selection. In kde 3.3 it takes from clipboard
rather like xclipboard does. Gnome must also have some sort of clipboard
daemon, but testing would mean running gnome, which I'm not too excited about
doing.

seed RNG from ~/.rnd and/or somesuch
