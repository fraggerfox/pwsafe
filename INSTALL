HOW TO BUILD FROM SOURCE TARBALL

   tar xzf <tarball>
   cd <dir>
   ./configure
   make
   make check     # to be sure it's working
   make install
   
And for the secure memory allocation to work, pwsafe must be install suid root

   chown root:root %install_prefix%/bin/pwsafe
   chmod +s %install_prefix%/bin/pwsafe


HOW TO BUILD FROM CVS

   cd <dir>
   aclocal        # generate aclocal.m4
   autoheader     # generate config.h.in from configure.ac
   automake       # generated Makefile.in from Makefile.am
   autoconf       # generate configure from configure.ac
   ./configure    # etc...; from here on you're on your own

You'll need autoconf 2.5 or better, as well as the header files for X11,
libreadline (which pulls in lib[n]curses) and openssl's libcrypto.

So far I've only built it on various linuxes (i386, sparc32, sparc64/debian
stable, debian unstable, redhat 8.0, 7.2, 6.2) with various g++ versions 
(3.3.3, 3.2, 2.95, 2.96 and even egcs-2.91).

According to others it builds on MacOS X as well.
