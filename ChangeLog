2005-02-18  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: added -q/--quiet at Jon Krom's request.

2005-02-17  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: apparently SUSE's autoconf's AC_SYS_POSIX_TERMIOS
	  macro sets ac_sys_posix_termios rather than am_..., so
	  now the if statement in configure.ac tests both.
	  (reported by Jon Krom)

2004-10-05  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: unknown tag/values in v2 files are preserved
	  instead of being stripped. This is probably the right thing
	  to do in the general case.

2004-10-03  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: added testv2.dat and added matching test to
	  ./selftest
	* pwsafe: added --mergedb
	
2004-10-02  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: added -G/--ignore with default value {klipper,
	  xclipboard}
	* pwsafe: added --exportdb
	* pwsafe: added --dbversion and support for pwsafe version 2.0
	  databases
	* pwsafe: now that we have -G/--ignore worked out, pasting
	  the login automatically advances the state. So now you can
	  say pwsafe -up NAME, <paste in login field>, <paste in password
	  field> and you are done. The old methods also still apply.

2004-03-01  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: first try case sensative perfect match.
        * pwsafe: release 0.1.6

2004-02-27  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: you can now end the X selection
          paste pressing any key. You can still, as
          always, end it by selecting something.
        * pwsafe: fixed up build on MacOSX (sysconf(_SC_PAGEZIZE)
          doesn't exist) and freebsd (readline.h declares
          most things correctly, but not the callbacks)

2004-02-25  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: added pwsafe.1.in
        * pwsafe: fixed (harmless) "yes" "yes" output
          from configure.
        * pwsafe: print out character length of suggested
          random password (useful for sites that have
          a length limit)
        * pwsafe: when suggested random password entropy
          gets under 64 bits decrement by 8 bits rather
          than the usual 32 bits.

2004-02-20  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: added a cheap substitute for getopt_long
          to help out OSes that don't have it (solaris). 
          You can also use it by specifying --without-getopt_long
          if you somehow don't like the better gnu one.
        * pwsafe: fixed getyn(string&) returning true all 
          the time, thus not allowing you to not use the 
          default username. getyn(const char*) wasn't
          broken so most YN questions were fine.
        * pwsafe: fixed typo in question "user default
          username?"
        * pwsafe: release 0.1.5

2004-02-17  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: added configure test for readline.h's
          that are C++ safe but don't use 'const' in
          their declarations. (openbsd)

2004-02-11  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: fixed massive booboo in secalloc. It
          worked for me by a miracle.
        * pwsafe: added 'make test' target test.dat and 
          check script so you can verify that pwsafe
          works automatically.
        * pwsafe: always print out where we are going to
          output the username/password, so that the user
          can see in advance where it is going to go and
          abort if they didn't mean for it to do there.
        * pwsafe: added --with-openssl-dir=dir to configure
          to allow linking with openssl in other locations
          than the default.
        * pwsafe: added --without-readline to configure
          to allow building without readline (you get a
          cheap read(STDIN_FILENO) instead).
        * pwsafe: fixed gramatical error in error msg.
        * pwsafe: release 0.1.4 to fix all these.
 
2004-02-09  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: implemented secstring and secalloc(ator)
          classes using mlock (like gpg does). You need
          to be suid root for it to work, though.
        * pwsafe: random number generator is seeded from
          ~/.rnd.
        * pwsafe: big hack to handle both g++ 2.9x and 
          g++ 3.[1-3]'s std::basic_string. Makes me want to
          implement my own string class and not depend on
          someone else's changing library.
        * pwsafe: release 0.1.3

2004-01-26  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: fixed -V/--version segfault.
        * pwsafe: fixed getyn() brokenness.
        * pwsafe: improved searching algorithm, now
          if the string perfecting matches (without
          regex matching) it's a match. And added
          case sensativity of -I/--case or if search
          string contains uppercase.
        * pwsafe: Split OP_LIST into OP_LIST and OP_EMIT.
          OP_EMIT is implicit if -u or -p is given.
        * pwsafe: implemented -e/--edit. (Renamed -e/--echo
          to -E/--echo.)
        * pwsafe: implemented randomly chosen passwords.
        * pwsafe: fixed char-at-a-time (~ICANON) buffering
          on sparc.
        * pwsafe: release 0.1.2
 
2004-01-23  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: updated man page and usage()
          both of which were obsolete.
        * pwsafe: released 0.1.1

2004-01-22  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: initial release version 0.1.0

2004-01-08  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: initial version.
